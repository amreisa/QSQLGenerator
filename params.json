There is a pro file and a visual studio 2008 solution\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nWhen you create database tables, the first field must be the key field.  The code assumes that ordinal 0 is the key field.\r\nAs you can see in my test database, I just use _id.\r\n\r\nOne more note.  If you are going to be inserting a large number of records, open a transaction and use commit when done.  This will\r\nmake an operation that takes 25 minutes without a transaction, take 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe code is released under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
